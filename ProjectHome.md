Playtime is a OllyDbg 2 Plugin which adds LuaJIT for scripting support. The plugin also supports NX breakpoints which are used to break-on-execute.

We developed this Plugin to go beyond limits with scripting, LuaJIT's FFI library will allow you declare and call C API within Lua, for more information about the FFI library please check the authors website: http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html

Keep in mind this is a very early stage of the Plugin, we are always looking forward for suggestions and ideas which could help the reverse engineering community.

Fore more information please check the included Readme.txt and examples in the release.
